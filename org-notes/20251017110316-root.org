Collecting notes about the what, why and how.

* Philosophy

** Pick the right tools for the right job

** Simplicity

*** Its not the same as easy

*** Trumps every other quality

** Do not take up something if you don't understand it

*** Delayed understanding is still ok, but do not delay it beyond a certain time

** Do not fear the hard path

** Reproducibility

*** Ability to run on different hardware profiles with minimal changes

*** Any modification done on the server is impure and cannot be replicated

**** Avoid or classify as debt and take care of it

** Call out inconsistencies where exists

** Efficiency

*** Usage of resources

*** Code efficiency ( not only code performance )

**** Succintness

**** Declarative nature

***** Use nix wherever possible

* Tools

** [[id:492543fb-fbc9-4d87-b1f5-fdfd191970da][Linux]]

** Hardware

*** [[id:2c0cccfe-a54e-4819-9981-d633e94b2120][Networking]]

*** [[id:14c3a8a4-6aa0-4da7-87b0-edefb9cc4138][Storage]]

*** [[id:e7dc0dd2-1463-4192-a904-0db2a6b9745b][Compute & Virtualization]]

** Data and Control Plane

*** Control plane is very crucial for this infrastructure.

*** No SPOF

*** May not need resources, but has to be planned very carefully

**** Listing some of them

     1. DHCP lease
     2. Consul's control plane
     3. Nomad's control plane
     4. Whether we choose ceph/minio/gluster/seaweed, will have some control plane
