#+title: Storage

* Two types of storage

** Block storage

*** Data is organized in blocks

*** Blocks are distributed amongst machines

**** Need to understand how addressing and dynamic scaling up/down happens

*** Examples

**** Glusterfs

** Object storage

*** Data is organized in key value stores

*** Data is accessed as only full objects mostly

*** s3 compatible api

*** Examples

**** minio

* Combined (offers both)

** Ceph

*** Complex

** Seaweedfs

*** Simpler

* Hardware characteristics

** Typically separate

*** Advantages
    1. Different characteristics than plain compute
    2. Requirement to scale out, repair, replace
    3. Can we add more compute while keeping the data the same?
