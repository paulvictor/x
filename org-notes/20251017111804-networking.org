#+title: Networking

* How to efficiently networking

* Internetworking

* Naming / Discovery

** We need a way for virtual machines to discover services

** How do we allocate names to each of them? (IP address/hostnames)?

*** [[https://developer.hashicorp.com/consul][Consul]] for service discovery

**** Pros

     1. Integrates well with nomad and the tf ecosystem
     2. Simpler
*** But for initial setup of tools like gluster, we need a way to address nodes.
**** Looking at static mapping of hostname to ip

*** [[https://github.com/isc-projects/kea][Kea]] for HA DHCP.

**** Why? We do not want to statically encode IP addresses.

**** So we run Kea in HA mode(2 or more instances)

***** To start off, we can run only a single instance
