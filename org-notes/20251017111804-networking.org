#+title: Networking

* How to efficiently networking

* Internetworking

* Naming / Discovery

** We need a way for virtual machines to discover services

** How do we allocate names to each of them? (IP address/hostnames)?

*** [[https://developer.hashicorp.com/consul][Consul]] for service discovery

**** Pros

     1. Integrates well with nomad and the tf ecosystem
     2. Simpler

*** [[https://github.com/isc-projects/kea][Kea]] for HA DHCP.

**** Why? We do not want to statically encode IP addresses.
